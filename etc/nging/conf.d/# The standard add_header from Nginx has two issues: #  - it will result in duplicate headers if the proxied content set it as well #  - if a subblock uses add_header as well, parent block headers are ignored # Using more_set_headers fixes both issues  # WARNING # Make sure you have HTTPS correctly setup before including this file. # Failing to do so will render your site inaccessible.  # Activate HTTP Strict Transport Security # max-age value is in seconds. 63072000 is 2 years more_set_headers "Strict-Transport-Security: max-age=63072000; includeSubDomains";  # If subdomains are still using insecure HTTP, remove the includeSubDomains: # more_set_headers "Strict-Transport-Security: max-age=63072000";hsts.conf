# The standard add_header from Nginx has two issues:
#  - it will result in duplicate headers if the proxied content set it as well
#  - if a subblock uses add_header as well, parent block headers are ignored
# Using more_set_headers fixes both issues

# Make sure you have HTTPS correctly setup before including this file.
# Failing to do so will render your site inaccessible.
